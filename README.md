AI Operations & Trading Workflows

About This Repository

This repository serves as a documentation hub for my current work in AI-driven operations and trading logic. While my background is in banking, I am currently transitioning into Applied AI, focusing on prompt engineering structures, workflow automation, and algorithmic trading logic.

My goal is to bridge the gap between technical implementation and operational execution.

🛠 Current Focus Areas

1. Trading Logic & Risk Management (Conceptual)

Developing disciplined, rule-based systems for financial markets.

Input: Multi-timeframe market structure analysis.

Processing: Identifying confluences (Technical Analysis + Sentiment).

Execution: Strict risk-reward ratios (minimum 1:2) with automated stop-loss calculations.

Optimization: Using AI to analyze journaled trades and identify behavioral biases.

2. Prompt Engineering Frameworks

I utilize a structured approach to prompting LLMs (Cursor/Claude/GPT-4) to ensure consistent outputs for business operations.

My Standard Prompt Structure:

Role: Define the persona (e.g., "Senior Python Architect" or "Legal Compliance Officer").

Context: Provide background data and constraints.

Task: Specific, actionable instruction.

Output Format: JSON, Markdown table, or bullet points.

Refinement: Iterative feedback loop based on edge cases.

3. Tool Stack

LLMs: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Cursor), GPT-4o.

IDE: Cursor (AI-first code editing).

Research: Perplexity AI for rapid information synthesis.

Operations: Notion for knowledge management and systemizing workflows.

Note: This repository is a living document of my transition from traditional banking to Applied AI Engineering.
